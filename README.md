Jenkins setup on AWS Autoscaling group, Load Balancer and EFS using Terraform, Packer and Ansible

![Readme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f30b219a-261d-4e88-a8e2-5695af7f9ff9)

In this project, you will learn how to deploy Jenkins on an AWS Autoscaling group with an Application Load Balancer and EFS filesystem for Jenkinsâ€™ data directory.

We aim to implement the following concepts in the project.

Immutable Infrastructure
Infrastructure as Code (Provisioning & Configuration Management)
External Config/Secret management

                                        TOOLS & SERVICES USED
For this Jenkins project, I have used the following DevOps Tools

GitHub: Repository to store IaC
Packer: To build Jenkins Controller and agent AMIs
Ansible: To configure Jenkins controller and agent during the AMI building process
Terraform: To provision AWS resources
Python Boto3: To retrieve SSH public key from AWS parameter store.
Following are the AWS services used.

IAM: To create IAM Role/Instance Profile for Jenkins Controller and Agent Nodes.
EFS: To store Jenkins data
AWS Parameter Store: To store SSH private and public keys as secrets to configure agents.
Autoscaling Group: To deploy the Jenkins controller
Application Load Balancer: To have a static DNS endpoint for the Jenkins controller instance running in the autoscaling group.
We will be using the default VPC in the us-west-2 (Oregon) region. There will be four default subnets. We will be using three subnets from the following three availability zones:

us-east-1a
us-east-1b
us-east-1c
Ensure you have an existing key pair in your AWS account for the N-virginia region. We will use it with instances to enable SSH access.
